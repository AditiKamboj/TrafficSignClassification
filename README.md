In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

Our approach to building this traffic sign classification model is discussed in four steps:

1. Explore the dataset
2. Build a CNN model
3. Train and validate the model
4. Test the model with test dataset
